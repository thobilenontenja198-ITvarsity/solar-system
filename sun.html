            <h1>The Sun</h1>
            <p class="intro">The Sun or Sol, is the star at the centre of our 
                solar system. 
                It is responsible for the Earth's climate and weather</p>
            <p>The sun is almost a perfect with a difference of just 10km
                in diameter between the poles an equator. 
                The average radius of the Sun 695,508km (109.2 x that of earth) of which 20-25% 
                is the core.</p>
            <p>If a hollow sun was filled up with spherical Earths then around 960,000 would fit inside.
                On the other hand if these earth were squished inside with no wasted space then around 1,300,000.
                The Sun surface area is 11,990 times that of the Eath's
            </p>
